# 🌫️ Air Quality Visualizer and Forecast App

A Machine Learning-powered web and mobile application that delivers real-time and predictive Air Quality Index (AQI) insights—especially for underserved rural and semi-urban regions. Built for a hackathon to address environmental data gaps and empower communities with actionable air quality data.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Millions in rural and smaller cities suffer from air pollution without access to proper AQI monitoring systems. This app aims to **bridge that gap** using:
- **IoT sensor integration**
- **ML models for AQI prediction**
- **Real-time weather and air quality visualization**
- **Multilingual support**

---

## 🎯 Features

- 🌍 **Real-time AQI & Weather Data**  
  Live readings using open APIs and/or local sensors.

- 📈 **ML-Based AQI Forecasting**  
  Predict AQI levels for the next 24-72 hours using regression models.

- 🧠 **Granular Insights**  
  Hyper-local predictions for areas typically ignored by mainstream apps.

- 📱 **Mobile + Web Dashboard**  
  Built using Flutter and web technologies for accessibility.

- 🌐 **Multilingual Interface**  
  Supports English + regional languages for wider reach.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

- **Model:** Random Forest Regressor / LSTM (customizable)
- **Inputs:** Temperature, humidity, wind speed, pollutant levels (PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO₂, etc.)
- **Outputs:** Forecasted AQI values (24/48/72 hours)
- **Training Dataset:** Historical AQI & weather datasets (OpenAQ, CPCB, etc.)
